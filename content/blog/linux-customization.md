 I delved deep into this rabbit hole during lockdown and it was fun. Here are some cool things you can try if you are a Linux user:

Check out  [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/) and [deskto.ps](https://deskto.ps/) to see some cool setups.
## Tiling Window Managers
TWMs are really popular on r/unixporn and a good starting point is [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/). It seems to be the most popular one. [Tsoding](https://www.youtube.com/@tsoding) and [ThePrimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/@tsoding) use this one. 
I used [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) because it was the most minimal one and it's somewhat hard to setup but you get to learn a bit of C programming and things about patching together software. 
## Terminal Emulators
You will be editing files in the terminal a lot so picking a terminal with good customizability is necessary. Changing the font and colorscheme can make great difference. I'd recommend [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/), I've used it for a long time and have had little issues. [st](https://st.suckless.org/) is a lightweight terminal you can use if you're using an old laptop.
## Terminal Applications
There a lot of terminal applications which aim to replace GUI applications. Here are some popular ones:
- [cmus](https://cmus.github.io/) - Music Player
- [mutt](http://www.mutt.org/) - Email Client
- [Deluge](https://deluge-torrent.org/) - BitTorrent Client
## Custom Keyboard Shortcuts
I used [sxhkd](https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd) to create shortcuts for commonly used software and scripts. This is very useful and its really cool working without your mouse. 
## Automation with Shell Scripts
This is the most useful thing you can learn from all of this. Learning cli like grep, find etc. can boost your productivity. You can automate a lot of repetitive tasks by making shell scripts
## Config Files
Editing config files or dotfiles is how you control everything about your setup. It is good to pick a text editor that runs in the terminal, [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/) can be a good starting point. 
You can search for config files on Github if you are trying new software and don't know much about them.
You can learn to use [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) if you edit a lot of files. It's harder to learn but makes editing files way faster.
